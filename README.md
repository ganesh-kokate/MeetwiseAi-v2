# Meetwise üß†üé•

**Meetwise** is a modern AI-powered meeting platform designed for teams and professionals who value efficiency and clarity. It enables seamless **real-time video conferencing** using **WebRTC** and automatically generates **meeting summaries, key notes**, and highlights of **important decisions**.
## ‚ú® Features

- üé• **Real-time Video & Audio Conferencing**  
  Built on WebRTC, Meetwise enables high-quality Many to Many Meetings without any third-party dependencies.

- üß† **AI-Powered Meeting Summaries**  
  Automatically transcribes and summarizes meeting discussions using Deepgram's speech-to-text engine.

- üìù **Action Items & Key Decision Extraction**  
  Highlights critical decisions, action items, and important moments from the conversation.

- ü§ñ **Headless Bot Integration**  
  A Puppeteer-powered bot can automatically join meetings, record audio, and trigger summarization workflows.

- üîê **Secure by Design**  
  JWT-based authentication with Spring Security ensures all APIs and interactions are fully protected.

- üß© **Modular Microservice Architecture**  
  Services are split by responsibility (Gateway, Auth-Service, Summarizer, etc.) for scalability and maintainability.

- üì¶ **Clean and Lightweight Frontend**  
  Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML for fast performance and easy integration with the signaling server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Reactive & Asynchronous Architecture

Meetwise leverages **Spring WebClient** for all inter-service and external HTTP calls, enabling non-blocking, reactive communication across the system.

- All internal service calls (e.g., to the summarizer) are handled asynchronously.
- Integration with **Deepgram** (for transcription) and **Groq** (for summary + action point extraction) is fully reactive using WebClient.
- This allows Meetwise to scale efficiently under concurrent user load, reducing blocking I/O and improving responsiveness.
